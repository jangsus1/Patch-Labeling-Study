# Instructions

## Overview

In this experiment, you will be presented with **scatterplots** representing relationships between two variables. Your task is to **estimate the correlation coefficient (r-value)** between them.

However, instead of seeing the full scatterplot immediately, you will use a **bubble-view method** to gradually uncover parts of the image.

## How It Works

### Step 1: **Exploring the Scatterplot**
- The scatterplot will be **initially blurred**.
- Click anywhere on the image to **reveal a small portion** (a "bubble").
- You can **click multiple times** to uncover different areas.
- The scatterplot will be visible for **15 seconds**.

### Step 2: **Making a Judgment**
- After 15 seconds, the scatterplot will disappear.
- You will see a **slider** ranging from **-1.0 to +1.0**.
- Move the slider to indicate **how strong you believe the correlation is**.
  - **-1.0** → Strong Negative Correlation
  - **0.0** → No Correlation
  - **+1.0** → Strong Positive Correlation

### Step 3: **Feedback**
- You will receive **immediate feedback** showing:
  - Your response.
  - The actual correlation value of the scatterplot.
- Try to tune your estimate in the following questions!

## Important Notes
✅ There is **no right or wrong way** to uncover the scatterplot—**use your best judgment**.  
✅ Try to **efficiently explore** key areas before making a decision.  
✅ Do **not refresh the page** during the experiment.
