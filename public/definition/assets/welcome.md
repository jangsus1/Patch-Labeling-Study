- Your goal is to follow the instructions and annotate the visualization through interaction.
- You must also answer the questions.

### 2. Interactions:
- You may click on the patches to reveal and annotate at the same time.
- You can always re-flip each patch by clicking on the patch again.

### 3. Completion:
