## Essential Area Labeling

You have 2 goals for your annotation task.
1. You should annotate the area that you think **must be revealed** for people to **confidently** answer the task.
2. You should keep the revealed area as **compact and small as possible**, but not violating the goal above.

### Things to keep in mind
- You may always take time to think
- You can unclick the areas that you've chosen.
