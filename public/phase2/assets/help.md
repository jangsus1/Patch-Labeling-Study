# Welcome to the Labeling Study - Experts

## Purpose of the Study

Thank you for participating in this labeling study! The goal of this study is to better understand how people identify and interact with **important areas** in visualizations to complete specific tasks or answer questions. Your valuable input will help improve the design of visualization systems and tools for human-computer interaction.

## What to Expect

### 1. Task Overview:
- You will be presented with a visualization.
- A specific question for the visualization or a general question will be provided.
- Your goal is to identify the "important" areas in the visualization through interaction and answer the question.

### 2. Interactions:
One of the three types of annotation tools will be available in each task:
  1. **Bubble View**: A blurry visualization will be shown initially. You can deblur specific areas by clicking on the screen.
  2. **Contour Toolbox**: A toolbox will appear on the left sidebar. You can draw a lasso or polygon to annotate the regions.
  3. **Grid View**: A blurry visualization will be shown initially. You can deblur specific patches by clicking on them.

### 3. Completion:
- Once you finish answering the question, click the **"Next"** button on the sidebar to proceed to the next task.

## Guidelines

- Carefully read the task or question associated with each visualization.
- Take your time to evaluate which areas are truly essential to answering the question or completing the task.
- There are no right or wrong answersâ€”focus on what you perceive as important.

## Tips for Participation

- Annotate as much as necessary but aim to focus only on areas you feel are critical for completing the task.
- If you're unsure about an area, feel free to explore further by clicking additional regions.
