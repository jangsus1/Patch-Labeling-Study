# Welcome to the Labeling Study â€“ Tool Comparisons  

## Purpose  
Thank you for participating! This study explores how people annoate visualizations with certain tasks. Your input will help improve visualization research.  

## Study Sequence  

1. **Consent** â€“ Review and agree to participate.  
2. **Tool Explanation** â€“ Learn how to use the annotation tool that will be assigned to you.  
3. **Example & Main Tasks**:  
   - **2 Example Tasks** â€“ Practice using the tool.  
   - **18 Main Tasks** â€“ Complete actual labeling tasks.  
4. **Task Difficulty Rating** â€“ Assess task difficulty using Likert scales.  
5. **Visualization Literacy Assessment (VLAT)** â€“ Measure visualization skills (**will not affect payment**).  
6. **Demographics** â€“ Answer basic demographic questions.  

## Task Overview  

- You will analyze a visualization and answer a question.  
- Follow the provided instructions to annotate the visualization.  
- Each task will use one of the following tools:  

### Annotation Tools  
- **Bubble View** â€“ Click to reveal areas in a blurred visualization.  
- **Contour Toolbox** â€“ Draw regions using lasso or polygon tools.  
- **Grid View** â€“ Click to reveal or hide patches.  

## Instructions  

- **Carefully read instructions for each task, as they may change.**
- Take your time to focus on which area you may annotate.  
- No right or wrong answersâ€”just follow your intuition.  
- Repeatedly failing attention-check questions will lead to automatic rejection.
