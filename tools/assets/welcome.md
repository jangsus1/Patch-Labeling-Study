# Welcome to the Labeling Study - Tool Comparisons

## Purpose of the Study

Thank you for participating in this labeling study! The goal of this study is to better understand how people identify and interact with **important areas** in visualizations to complete specific tasks or answer questions. Your valuable input will help improve the design of visualization systems and tools for human-computer interaction.

## What to Expect

**Carefully read the instructions before starting the annotation, as they may vary depending on the task.**

### 1. Task Overview:
- You will be presented with a visualization.
- A specific question for the visualization will be provided.
- Your goal is to follow the instructions and annotate the visualization through interaction.
- You must also answer the questions.

### 2. Interactions:
One of the three types of tools will be available in each task:
  1. **Bubble View**: A blurry visualization will be shown initially. You can deblur specific areas by clicking on the screen.
  2. **Contour Toolbox**: A toolbox will appear on the left sidebar. You can draw a lasso or polygon to annotate the regions.
  3. **Grid View**: A covered visualization will be shown initially. You can reveal specific patches by clicking on them.

### 3. Completion:
- Once you finish answering the question, click the **"Next"** button on the sidebar to proceed to the next task.
- There are total 2 example and 20 main tasks.

## Guidelines

- **First read the instructions in every page, as it may differ from task to task.**
- Take your time to evaluate which areas are truly essential to answering the question or completing the task.
- There are no right or wrong answersâ€”focus on what you perceive as important.
- Failing to answer the attention-check questions more than once, your submission will be automatically rejected.
