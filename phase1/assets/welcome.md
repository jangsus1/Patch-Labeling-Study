# Correlation Perception Experiment

## Welcome to the Study!

Thank you for participating in our research on **visual perception of correlations**.  

In this study, you will estimate the relationships between two variables by analyzing scatterplots. However, instead of viewing the scatterplot in full, you will **gradually reveal parts of it** by clicking on the image.

Your participation is **voluntary**, and you may withdraw at any time. The experiment will take approximately **10 minutes** to complete.

If you are ready, press **Next** to proceed to the consent form and instructions.
